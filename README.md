# odin-recipes

This is a project built for The Odin Project's Foundations Curriculum.

This project puts together the basics of HTML I've learned from The Odin Project.

Throughout the project, I learned HTML boilerplate, basic page structuring, embedding image and links, and using special symbols like fractions and degrees.

I also learnt the basic workflow of Git, and navigating Linux and the terminal, along with some new shortcuts for VS Code.

The recipes for onion rings and mozzarella sticks were copied from allrecipes.com.
