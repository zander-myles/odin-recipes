        <li>1 &frac12; cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>

        <li>Heat oil to 185&deg;C in a large, heavy saucepan.</li>
        <li>Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat. Place breaded mozzarella stick on a plate or wire rack. Repeat with remaining mozzarella sticks.</li>
